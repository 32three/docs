# Murano Platform

![murano overview](assets/platform_overview.png)

# Introduction
The Murano hosted software platform allows you to deploy full IoT solutions, from device to user applications by providing tools, infrastructure, and example starting templates.  IoT is more than just connecting things to the internet - it is a mash-up of resource-constrained `things` (not computers) and overlaying concepts of `application logic`, `user roles / permissions`, and `business integration`.  Murano provides this `full stack` of IoT, already integrated allowing developers to focus on creating value and interesting functionality rather than building and maintaining infrastructure, protocols, and lots of integration work.
