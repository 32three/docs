# Solution Overview

![murano overview](assets/platform_overview.png)

Murano Solutions allow developers to create and deploy custom Applications and API Services.  Solutions combines three key things:
* A custom API with definable end-point routes, scripted logic, and integration with a User Service for permission control
* Asset hosting for deploying static file based applications, like a CDN
* Service event handler scripts that have access to all Murano [services](/murano/services)
