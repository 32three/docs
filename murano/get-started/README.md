# Getting Started with Murano
Getting started is easy and free.  To provide the best starting context after signing up for an account, you'll be walked through the steps to create an example consumer IoT product. This includes setting up a Product, connecting a physical device (or device simulator), and interacting with device data on a dashboard.  Murano will then provide the steps to walk through cloning a Solution Application and deploying it - allowing you to interact with your device via a fully custom web application in minutes.

## Creating a Product Quick-Start
You can choose from several starting points when creating a product depending on if you have physical hardware, plan to use simulated device software, or manual API commands.   Each of these provides instructions for creating the product, defining it, and adding devices.

### Murano Product Getting Started Options
* [Murano Product Getting Started - Arduino based IoT Thing Dev board by Sparkfun - Example Code / Hook-up Guide](products/esp8266_thingdev_murano_smart_lightbulb)
* [Murano Product Getting Started - Manually Activate and Write Data](products/manualdevice)
* [Murano Product Getting Started - Python Device Simulator Script](products/pythonsim)
* Murano Product Getting Started - Microchip WCM kit (coming soon)

At the end of these walk-throughs, you should have a physical device or simulated device that represents a Smart Lightbulb:
 * Connected to the Murano Platform
 * Reporting sensor data
 * Remote on/off control


## Creating Application Solutions Quick-Start
Murano walks you through cloning and deploying a sample Smart Light bulb consumer application.  

* [Murano Solution Application Getting Started](solutions/exampleapp)

The example consumer application provides all the source code, template files, and configuration for building and deploying a connected product and application.  At the end of this walk-through, you should have:
* A deployed web application that has:
 * Unique user sign-up and log-in
 * Ability for users to claim ownership of devices
 * Users can see device sensor data and turn the light on/off
 * Users can invite a shared user to access the light.
