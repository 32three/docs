# Getting Started with Murano
Getting started is easy and free.  To provide the best starting context after signing up for an account, you'll be walked through the steps to create an example consumer IoT product. This includes setting up a Product, connecting a physical device (or device simulator), and interacting with device data on a dashboard.  Murano will then provide the steps to walk through cloning a Solution Application and deploying it - allowing you to interact with your device via a fully custom web application in minutes.

# Prerequisites
IoT obviously involves connecting 'things' and typically these things are development kits from Microcontroller companies, small embedded computers and gateways, or open-source hardware platforms.  

The Example Consumer IoT Application for Murano has several options for using physical hardware, simulated software, and manual API calls.  Each has a prerequisites which are documented in that starting points guide, see below in the [Creating Product section below](#create-the-product).

# Example: Creating a Consumer IoT Application
The example consumer application provides all the source code, template files, and configuration for building and deploying a connected product and application.  At the end of this walk-through, you should have:
* A physical device that represents a Smart Lightbulb:
 * Connected to the Murano Platform
 * Reporting sensor data
 * Remote on/off control
* A deployed web application that has:
 * Unique user sign-up and log-in
 * Ability for users to claim ownership of devices
 * Users can see device sensor data and turn the light on/off
 * Users can invite a shared user to access the light.

Murano walks you through adding a development kit or device simulator - as a example Smart Light bulb consumer product.  

You can choose from several starting points when creating a product depending on if you have physical hardware, plan to use simulated device software, or manual API caommands.   Each of these provides instructions for creating the product, defining it, and adding devices.
