# Getting Started with Murano
Getting started is easy and free.  To provide the best starting context after signing up for an account, you'll be walked through the steps to create an example consumer IoT product. This includes setting up a Product, connecting a physical device (or device simulator), and interacting with device data on a dashboard.  Murano will then provide the steps to walk through cloning a Solution Application and deploying it - allowing you to interact with your device via a fully custom web application in minutes.

# Prerequisites
IoT obviously involves connecting 'things' and typically these things are development kits from Microcontroller companies, small embedded computers and gateways, or open-source hardware platforms.  The out of box walk-through in Murano will help with connecting a recommended device, but will also provide a link to run a device simulator using a Python script.

### Murano Getting Started Device Options
* [Python Simulator]()
* Microchip WCM kit
* [Arduino based IoT Thing Dev board by Sparkfun - Example Code / Hook-up Guide](https://github.com/maanenson/murano_arduino_examples/tree/master/esp8266_thingdev_murano_smart_lightbulb)

Connecting a device and seeing data on the prototyping dashboard is something anyone can do.  Murano also provides a walk through of cloning and deploying a web application and the custom public back-end APIs for that application.  Some command line experience will be needed for this step and we'll walk you through it, to be sure you can try out all of the features of Murano.  

# Example Consumer IoT Application
The example consumer application provides all the source code, template files, and configuration for building and deploying a connected product and application.  At the end of this walk-through, you should have:
* A physical device that represents a Smart Lightbulb:
 * Connected to the Murano Platform
 * Reporting sensor data
 * Remote on/off control
* A deployed web application that has:
 * Unique user sign-up and log-in
 * Ability for users to claim ownership of devices
 * Users can see device sensor data and turn the light on/off
 * Users can invite a shared user to access the light.  

## Creating the Product
Murano walks you through adding a development kit or device simulator - as a example Smart Light bulb consumer product.  


## Creating the Application Solution
Murano walks you through cloning and deploying a sample Smart Light bulb consumer application.
