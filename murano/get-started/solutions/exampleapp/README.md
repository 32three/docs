# GETTING STARTED - CREATE A SOLUTION & DEPLOY CHANGES
This is a quick start guide to using Exosite Murano Solutions.  When you are done following this guide, you will have built, deployed, and used an example IoT application with the following features:

* User Login
* User Profiles
* Device Provisioning
* Real Time Device Data
* Device Control

If you already have a Murano account, lets get started!

#STEP 1: Create a solution

Create a solution using the home automation example as a starting point here: (https://www.exosite.io/business/solutions)

**Note: You may have to delete your previous solution if you are on a free account.**

To verify the Template File worked, click the "Routes" menu item - you should see something like this: 

![Routes Example](assets/routes_example.png)

You now have a responsive web app communicating with the connected product! 

#STEP 2: TRY OU TTHE EXAMPLE APP

Sign up for an account on your new example app. 

**NOTE: You won’t be able to login with your Exosite Murano credentials. This is a totally separate application that you just deployed on the Murano platform, with a separate user database.**

Click on the email verification link. 

In your application, add a lightbulb using the MAC address/serial number of the device you added earlier from the python simulator or the Sparkfun ThingDev board. 

You should see data from the lightbulb - current humidity, temperature, and on/off state!
