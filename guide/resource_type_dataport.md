The Dataport
============

A dataport's primary use is the storing of data that needs no prior
processing. Dataports are the best choice when data sourced by a real
world entity must be stored with no prior processing other than what a
resource's generic preprocessing capabilities can handle.

Description
-----------

Dataports are fully described by the common set of description
properties and require no further description.

Processing
----------

Dataport resources do not implement actual processing of data. Output
values from preprocessing will pass through the processing stage
unchanged before being stored in the time series database and published
to subscribing resources.
