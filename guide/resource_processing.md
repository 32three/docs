Processing
==========

The second processing stage, which is also the main processing that a
resource does, receives the output from the preprocessing stage. The
type of processing done in this stage is resource type specific and is
individually discussed in the 'Processing' section for each resource.

-   [Client](resource_type_client.md)
-   [Dataport](resource_type_dataport.md)
-   [Datarule](resource_type_datarule.md)
-   [Dispatch](resource_type_dispatch.md)

Output from the main processing stage is stored in time series database
and published to subscribing resources.
