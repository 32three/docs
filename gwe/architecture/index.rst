This section of the Gateway Engine documentation is to detail and discuss the functionality design of the Gateway Engine framework. This intended audience of this section is a developer of web applications, embedded systems or IoT systems in general.

If you're looking for information on high-level concepts about how the Gateway Engine client model is designed then you'll be most interested to read the :ref:`gwe` section.

If, after reading the :ref:`gwe` section you're still looking for more examples and a more in-depth look at client models and Gateway Engine architecture, you'll be interested in the :ref:`advanced` section.
