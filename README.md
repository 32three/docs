## One Platform APIs

Are you looking to create an application that uses the One Platform API? You've come to the right place. Exosite provides APIs and libraries that make it possible to work with the platform from a variety of environments. 

### APIs

* [HTTP Data Interface API](data/) - low bandwidth API for reading from and writing to dataports
* [Remote Procedure Call API](rpc/) - full featured API for device management and data visualization
* [Provision/Device Management API](provision/) - API for working with device models and in field provisioning
* [UDP Single Shot API](udp/) - very low bandwidth and overhead API for writing to a single dataport
* [Commander API](commander/) - XMPP chat interface for reading and writing data from an IM client
* [Lua Scripting API](scripting/) - the server-side Lua scripting environment
* [Portals Custom Widget API](widget/) - a Javascript API for creating custom Portals widgets.
